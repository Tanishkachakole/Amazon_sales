## Amazon Sales End-to-End SQL  Project

This is an end-to-end SQL project based on an Amazon Sales system, where I have designed the database, created relationships between tables, and solved multiple real-world business problems using SQL.

This project focuses on practical database design, data handling, and query optimization similar to real e-commerce systems.

# Project Overview

In this project, I worked completely on SQL to simulate an Amazon-like sales system.
The goal was to understand how a real-world sales database works and how SQL can be used to manage and analyze large-scale data.

Key Highlights:

- End-to-end SQL based project
- Realistic e-commerce database structure
- Business problem solving using SQL queries
- Automation using stored procedures

Database Design (ER Diagram)

Below is the ER Diagram representing the complete database structure used in this project:

"ER Diagram" (amazon_ER digram.png)

The ER diagram shows relationships between all tables such as products, customers, orders, inventory, payments, etc.»

Database Details

- Total Tables Used: 9
- Orders Data Size: ~21,000 records
- Data Type: Fake data generated using Python
- Relationships: Proper primary key and foreign key relationships implemented

This large dataset helps simulate real-world data volume and improves query performance understanding.

Problems Solved

In this project, I solved 18 different SQL problems, covering:

- Sales analysis
- Customer-based queries
- Product ranking
- Revenue calculation
- Inventory tracking
- Order history analysis

These problems helped strengthen my understanding of joins, subqueries, grouping, and ranking functions.

Stored Procedure

A stored procedure is created to handle the following automatically:

- Insert new order data
- Update inventory automatically when an order is placed
- Maintain proper order records

This simulates real-time transactional behavior in an e-commerce system.
